There are many kinds of music, such as pop music, R&B, country music, rock music and so on. Among those kinds of music, piano music is my favorite. Some people might be not familiar to piano music, they prefer other kinds of music more. But to me, piano music is the best one among those ones. I like it for two reasons; one is that music is played by piano, the other one is that the melody is soft and makes me relax.

I like piano music because it is played by piano which is my favorite. Piano is my favorite instrument. As I had played piano for six years, so I have special feeling toward it. I personally think that piano is a symbol of dignity and elegance. So I enjoy the music played by piano very much.

Another reason for me to like it is its melody which relaxes me a lot. Id like to listen to piano music when Im free especially after study. Because the melody piano made is soft which can help me to reduce the stress and then relax myself.
I enjoy listening to piano music. It is also a way for me to be happy
