Hobby is a particular and most interesting habit than other habit of any person. Hobby is a good thing which must be with everyone. Hobby is very necessary to be with everyone because it makes one busy and free mind. It never leaves alone us and prevents from the psychological problems. I still remember that when I was just 3 years old I generally liked to spend my spare time in my green garden. I like very much to be with my father in the garden everyday in the early morning. When I was kid, my father generally laughed at me while seeing watering plants. But now he becomes so proud of me that I do something to save plants life and understand their value and importance in the existence of life on the earth.

Hobbies are our daily lives activities which we must do. It helps us to get escaped from the daily crush of life. It gives us immense pleasure and peace of body, mind and soul. It is like yoga and meditation and even benefits more than that. It draws our mind towards creativity and promote us to do something better in the life. Good hobbies dramatically improve our personality and character traits as well as improve our performances. It helps in discovering our talents and abilities and uses them in right direction. Our hobbies make our mind fresh and peaceful by keeping us away from the daily rush of life.

My favourite hobby is gardening and l like so much planting new plants and watering them in daily morning. The enjoy seeing flowers blooming and plants growing. I really feel sense of great achievements and realize the fact of life. It helps me keep myself fit, healthy, strong and rejuvenate. Watering plants and gardening on daily basis is a best exercise for me which positively moulds my mind and body.
